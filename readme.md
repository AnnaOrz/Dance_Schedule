# Purpose:
Imagine you are owner of new dance school or fitness club. 
You want your clients to easily sign up online for classes.
They need to buy a carnet with entrances and from active carnet one entrance is collected each time user sign up for any class. 
Also as the owner you can add classes, carnets that are allowed to be bought and cancell classes.
When class is cancelled by you all signed clients will get back an entrance. 

## Technologies used:
* Java
* Spring security
* Spring boot
* Hibernate
* JSP

In this project I experimented first time with Spring Security. I predicted users to have only one role.
CSS styling got from ready bootstrap. 

## Functionalities
**As an admin:**
* create and manage classes
* create and manage types of carnets (blueprint for carnets)
* activate registered users
* manage carnets
* manage users

**As an user**
* choose and buy a carnet
* sign up for classes (if you have active carnet)
* see your carnets and classes
* edit your personal data
* opt out from a class (if you do this early you will not loose entrance from carnet)
* sign for reserve list if there is already full complement for class
