Purpose: Imagine you are owner of new dance school or fitness club. 
You want your clients to easily sign in for classes online.
They need to buy a carnet with entrances and from active carnet one entrance is collected when user sign up for any class. 
Also as the owner you can add classes, carnets that are allowed to be bought and cancell classes.
When class is cancelled by you all signed clients will get back an entrance. 
Those and more funcionalities you'll find in this web-app


In this project I experimented first time with Spring Security. I predicted one role for each user and used only basic implementation.
